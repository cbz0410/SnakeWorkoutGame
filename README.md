# SnakeWorkoutGame

Using my reverse-engineered Snake game, I created an original spin on the base game: Snake Workout. 

You play as the Wrestling Snake, who is trying to meet a weight class. Collect the dumbbells in the attempt to shrink to a size of one.

 In this project, I expanded on my knowledge gained in the Snake project, including:
-  More efficient trigger detection
-  A win screen with UI and clickable buttons that function as intended
-  A Workout() method that properly decreases the size of the player
-  A smaller play area to make the game more challenging
